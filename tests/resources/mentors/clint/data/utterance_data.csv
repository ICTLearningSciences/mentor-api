clintanderson_U1_1_1,"My name is EMC Clint Anderson. I was born in California and I have lived there most of my life. I graduated from Paramount and a couple of years after I finished high school, I joined the US Navy. I was an Electrician's Mate. I served on an aircraft carrier for eight years and then afterwards, I went to the United States Navy Reserve. During that time I started going to school with some of the abundant benefits that the military reserve has given me and I started working with various companies.",_INTRO_
